# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis


## Overview and Purpose of Project
---
The purpose of this project was to analyze a group of data containing Kickstarter campaigns and their successes or failures in the theater/play category.



## Analysis and Challenges
---


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
---
For this analysis, across all years, May and June appeared to have the most successful Kickstarter campaigns for the theater category respectively. Out of 166 theater Kickstarter campaigns for May, 111 were successful and 52 unsuccessful. Out of 153 theater Kickstarter campaigns for June, 100 were success and 49 unsuccessful. There were only 7 total canceled campaigns in both months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
---
For this analysis, we gathered data based on successful, unsuccessful, and canceled Kickstarter campaigns for plays based on the monetary goal of those campaigns. In the table and line chart provided, the analysis shows that the most successful campaigns were between 0-4999 dollars. There were no canceled play campaigns for any goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
---
While conducting this analysis, there were no real challenges or difficulties encountered. One challenge possibility could have been if the date conversion formula was not readily available. The data would have been impossible to comprehend or filter based on the data set given only the original values.

## Results
---
Based on the outcomes based on launch date across all years, you can conclude that theater/play Kickstarter campaigns are most successfully conducted in the months of May and June. Additionally, December had almost just as many unsuccessful campaigns as it did successful ones. 
---
Outcomes based on goals showed that the most successful Kickstarter campaigns for plays had goals under 5000 dollars. Goals set over 45000 dollars yielded the most unsuccessful campaigns. 
---
This dataset had some limitations including not filtering by country, which may have given us more specific results. Also, this data contains years ranging from 2014 to 2017. Because of the evolution of Kickstarter, more recent years could help us conclude even more accurate results. Other graphs could have been filtered for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date with specific years to analyze if the results varied year over year.
